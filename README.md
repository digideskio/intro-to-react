# intro-to-react

This is the sample project I built while watching [@AlwaysBCoding](http://twitter.com/AlwaysBCoding)'s fantastic YouTube video [Introduction to React Native - Building a React Native app from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OPRhelEIU).

Try this sample:

`react-native run-ios`
